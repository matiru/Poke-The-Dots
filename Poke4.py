# Poke The Dots Version 4
# This is a graphical game where two dots move around
# the screen, bouncing off the edges. The user tries 
# to prevent the dots from colliding by pressing and 
# releasing the mouse button to teleport the dots to 
# a random location. The score is the number of seconds 
# from the start of the game.
